# ExamSchedule
by Saira Billah and Isabel Ma for CS 102 Section C Fall 2021
# Introduction
This project takes inputs from the user about their upcoming exams and provides the user with the amount of time each day they should spend studying for each exam. 
# Technical Description
First, the user is asked what day of the week it is so the code knows what day to start the schedule on. Then, the user is asked how many exams they have to study for, how difficult each exam is, and how much time the user has to study for the exam. Using the information that the user has inputted, the code figures out which exam is more significant to study for based on the amount of time the user has to study for the exam and how difficult the user says that exam is. After the code determines which exam is more significant to study for, it then determines how much time you should spend studying for each exam using the information inputted by the user about how much time they have to study for the exam and how much free time on each day of the week they have to study for the exam. After all of that is determined, the computer outputs a schedule for the user, telling the user how much time they should spend studying for each exam.
